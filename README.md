# Alexa Utterances and Intent Recognition

## Overview

This project explores the use of BERT models to map user utterances to intents for Amazon Alexa. Utilizing the MASSIVE dataset from AmazonScience, we evaluate three models: 
1. BERT with pooler output
2. BERT with averaged output
3. BERT + CNN

Our experiments reveal that the BERT + CNN model achieves the highest validation accuracy of over 0.50.

## Setup and Usage

### Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Google Colab (recommended for running model notebooks)
