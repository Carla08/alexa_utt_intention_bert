# alexa_utt_intention_bert
Alexa Utterances and Intent Recognition This project explores BERT models for mapping Alexa user utterances to intents using the MASSIVE dataset. We evaluate three models: BERT with pooler output, BERT with averaged output, and BERT + CNN. The BERT + CNN model achieved the highest validation accuracy of over 0.50.
